# Tolentinterest - my own version of Pinterest

https://tolentinterest.herokuapp.com/#/

## Basic Overview

This is my ongoing endeavor to implement a clone of the popular site Pinterest.
For nomenclature, Tins are the Pins from the original site, as well as Shelves
instead of Boards.

## Technologies

Tolentinterest utilizes a Rails Backend with React Frontend and CSS styling.
Images are hosted on AWS S3 with the site deployed on Heroku.

## Future project directions:

7/06 - There is still a lot of refactoring to take place, but the issue
preventing initial deployment has been fixed. Tin show page still has to be
implemented, as well as being able to upload and create new tins.
